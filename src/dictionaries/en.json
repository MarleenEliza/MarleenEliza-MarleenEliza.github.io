    "overview": "Whilst working at an international design company, I was part of a project to work on a landing page for an art institution. The page should feel unique and ‘alive’; constant movement is to be expected.",
    "key_responsibilities": [
      "In charge of all the animated elements including SVG morphed shapes and waves",
      "Working together closely with the designer (client), to ensure that their unique vision was put to live."
    ],
    "key_challenges": [
      "The page featured an iconic. morphing animation at the beginning in which very specific shaped elements should smoothly morph into other very specifically shaped SVGs. This was something I had never done before and getting the animation to feel smooth was a challenge with just CSS.",
      "The overlapping colors of the morphing animation at the begging should feel dymanic and interact with one another; changing the color to either white or purple. It was challenging to ensure the right color for each element and required a lot of layering and usage of css-blend-mode"
